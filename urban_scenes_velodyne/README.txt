Urban Scenes Velodyne Point Cloud Dataset
Authors: Kevin Lai and Dieter Fox

This package contains ten labeled point clouds collected using a velodyne laser mounted on top of a vehicle driving through an urban area. Each point cloud is stored as an ASCII file. Each line in the file is a single 3D point, e.g.

o14 8.557900 10.038971 0.787641 car

Here 'o14' denotes that this point belongs to object #14 and 'car' is the class of this point. Ground points are denoted by 'g' and always has class 'ground'. 

This data set was used in evaluating the object recognition technique described in
